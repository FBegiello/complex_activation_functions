Complex activation functions for ANN models
===============
Old project exploring complex variants of activation functions on MNIST set. Simple exploration of few complex function ideas - comes with ready to import module containing all the wariants.

File list
---------------
- **activationFunctions.py** - module containing all the experimental functions, ready to import and use out of the box.
- **Activation test (MNIST).ipynb** - simple experiment comparing performance of various widespread functions against the new, experimental ones on MNIST set
